Capistrano receipe for WordPress

== Usage

 gem install wp-capistrano
 cd /path/to/wordpress/wp-content
 wpcapify .
 vim lib/config.yml
 cap setup # once
 cap deploy

Configuration options:

[application.repository] The repository that contains wp-content
[wordpress.repository]   By default, it uses our GitHub mirror
[wordpress.version]      A git tree-ish, which can be a branch name, tag, or a commit hash (e.g. v3.0.1)
[deploy.*]               These names are used when doing cap deploy when deploying to non-default environments (i.e. cap production deploy)
[deploy.*.default]       Set this to true to make this the default target
[deploy.*.ssh_user]      The deploy user (who should have write access to +path+ on the remote machine)
[deploy.*.ssh_domain]    The host where the site lives
[deploy.*.path]          The path on the remote machine
[deploy.*.vhost]         The HTTP hostname - sets WP_HOME and WP_SITEURL
[deploy.*.database.*]    All the database settings (name, user, host, password)
[deploy.*.modules]       A list of modules that should be enabled

Before you run <tt>cap setup</tt> or <tt>cap deploy</tt>, you should ensure the path on the remote machine exists and is chmodded such that the deploy user can write to it.

To deploy to production rather than staging, for instance:

 cap production deploy

== Modules

These are configured in deploy.*.modules:

[plugin-install] Makes the plugin directory writable by all, and creates the upgrade directory
[shared-dirs]    Copies local directory to remote machine at setup time, and makes it writable by all
[wp-super-cache] Sets up WP Super Cache, including wp-config, and setting up the appropriate cache directories

Note: Some modules are set with a string, others are set with a hash. For instance:

 - modules:
   - plugin-install
   - shared-dirs:
     - plugins
     - uploads
   - wp-super-cache

== Automagic features

=== SASS

If there exists wp-content/themes/*/*/sass_output.php it will be executed locally and its contents will be uploaded as sass_output.css. Then style.css will be sedded to s/\.php/\.css/.

A sample sass_output.php can be found in wp-generate ( http://github.com/dxw/wp-generate ).

=== htaccess

Uploads ./htaccess to .htaccess if it exists.

=== Fixing plugins

Some plugins require esoteric setups. We fix these automatically:

- Cforms
